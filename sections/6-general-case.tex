\frametitle{Mihăilescu's proof of the general case}

While we've managed to solve a few special cases of Catalan's equation and bounded how large possible solutions could be, we'd like to get a proof which works for \emph{all} possible values of the exponents \(p\) and \(q\). \\[1em]

In order to do so, we will have to move the problem towards a special type of algebraic number fields: cyclotomic fields.
