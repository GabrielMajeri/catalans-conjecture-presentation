# Presentation on Catalan's Conjecture

## Description

This repository contains the LaTeX source files for a presentation I gave on [Catalan's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture), including: a brief history of the conjecture, the solution of various particular cases and Preda MihÄƒilescu's proof of the general case in 2004.

I gave a talk based on theses slides at the 2023 edition of the [Students' Scientific Communications Session](https://fmi.unibuc.ro/sesiune-de-comunicari-stiintifice-studentesti/) at [FMI-UniBuc](https://fmi.unibuc.ro/).

You can access the rendered PDF [here](https://github.com/GabrielMajeri/catalans-conjecture-presentation/releases/download/v1.0/catalans-conjecture.pdf).
